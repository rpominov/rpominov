### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Roman. Iâ€™m currently working on a tool that will make SQL queries type-safe by generating TypeScript / Flow / ReScript types for your SQL queries: https://github.com/rpominov/typesafe-sql

#### Support

I donâ€™t have a job, and would rather focus on open source if I can. If you want to support me financially, I would gladly accept Bitcoin at this address: TODO
